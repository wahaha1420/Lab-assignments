# Lab-assignments Pin-Chi
My name is Pin-Chi, and I am a third-year medical student at the National Yang-Ming Chiao-Tung University. This Github repo currently contains the 3 assignments: tic-tac-toe_python for the Python Programming, Python_for_Data_Science. The Single-Cell RNA-Seq project is still in progress, and I will update the code once it is completed.

Thank you!
